This thesis project studies the dynamic dimensioning of operating reserves. When we talk about operating reserves, we refer to the Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR) and the Frequency Restoration Reserves (FRR), which consist of automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR) and manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR).

The methodology that has been used broadly until recently is static, relying primarily on historical data to estimate the required reserve levels for a year ahead. This approach is based on a fixed calculation that doesnâ€™t account for variations in the energy system over time.

However, this static method is becoming outdated. The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power has introduced a higher level of uncertainty into the energy market. This uncertainty, driven by fluctuating generation from renewable sources, highlights the need for more flexible and adaptive methods in determining reserve requirements.

As a result, there is a growing emphasis on dynamic approaches, which aim to optimize the reserve levels on a more granular, daily basis. This project aims to explore the dynamic dimensioning of operating reserves and develop strategies that can respond to the challenges posed by the increased share of renewables in the energy mix
